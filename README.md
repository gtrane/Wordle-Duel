# Wordle-Duel
Python code used to track your win ratio of you and a partner for Wordle. I was interested in tracking how often me or my partner beats the other in the popular NY Times game Wordle. I utilized Jupyter Notebooks to create a dataframe that tracks the amount of wins, losses, and ties, and calculates our win ratios against each other!

Wordle_Duel.html shows my code for the program.
