# Wordle Duel
A fun personal project during my Wordle days! I used python to created a tracker/leaderboard for Wordle. I was interested in tracking how often me or my partner beats the other in Wordle. The created dataframe tracks the amount of wins, losses, and ties, and calculates the win ratio of each player. 

'Wordle_Duel.ipynb' shows my code for the program.
