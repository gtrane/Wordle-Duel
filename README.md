# Wordle Duel
A fun personal project during the height of my Wordle addiction. Faced with the unknown and ever-important question, which one of us is better at Wordle? I utilized python Jupyter Notebooks to create a leaderboard. This simple dataframe seamlessly tracks the amount of wins/losses/ties over time and calculates each player's win ratio. 

'Wordle_Duel.ipynb' shows my code for the program.
